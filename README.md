# DemoGame

This game shows how the use of a data structure can dramatically increase the speed of an app.

To run the game in "slow" mode, open the file in a browser. This slow mode check collisions between circles in a $n^2$ way.

To run the game in "fast" mode, set the use hashes to true. This faster mode uses a hash table to limit the number of collision calculations that are used.
